Generation of drug molecules for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. 
GSK-3beta inhibitors with high activity. 
These molecules can bind to GSK-3beta protein, molecules has low brain-blood barrier permeability.\
Compounds that contain heterocyclic moieties to enhance binding affinity for amyloid-beta aggregates.\
Hot keys: inhibitory activity against glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK-3Î²); compound should \
demonstrate a permeability coefficient of at least 1.5 to ensure effective crossing of the blood-brain barrier; \
tau protein kinases with an IC50 value lower than 50 nM.
