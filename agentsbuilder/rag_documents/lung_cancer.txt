    Generation of molecules for the treatment of lung cancer. \
    Molecules are inhibitors of KRAS protein with G12C mutation. \
    The molecules are selective, meaning they should not bind with HRAS and NRAS proteins.\
    Its target KRAS proteins with all possible mutations, including G12A/C/D/F/V/S, G13C/D, \
    V14I, L19F, Q22K, D33E, Q61H, K117N, G12C and A146V/T.\
    Hot keys: HRAS and NRAS proteins; KRAS G12C protein mutation, which drives cancer growth in lung cancer;\
    avoiding binding to HRAS and NRAS; low cross-reactivity with other RAS isoforms;  molecules to specifically bind and inhibit KRAS G12C
